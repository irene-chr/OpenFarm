The increasing importance of cybersecurity, resulting from the sustained digitalization of almost
every aspect of everyday life, is undeniable. SMEs and MEs now share similar needs with larger
enterprises in terms of digital security but often lack the resources or expertise to fulfil them.
PALANTIR project proposes a cybersecurity framework combining privacy assurance, data
protection, incident detection and recovery aspects under the same platform, focusing on cyberresilience of SMEs and compliance with the relevant data privacy and protection regulations.
